### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Rafael and this is my Github account =D                                        
                                                                                    
All programs here are related, in some extent, to: _Numerical Analysis_ and _Data Science_;
_LaTeX_; _Discrete Event Simulations_; and _GNU/Linux_ stuff.        

<strong>Recently, the areas that interest me most are</strong>
+ Probability and Real Analysis 
+ Machine Learning (kind love this book [Understanding Machine Learning
From Theory to Algorithms](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/understanding-machine-learning/3059695661405D25673058E43C8BE2A6))
+ Topological Data Analysis
+ Stochastic Processes and their application in simulations
