Programs here are all related to: Numerical Analysis and Data Science; LaTeX;       
Discrete Event Simulations; and GNU/Linux stuff.        

<strong>Recently, the areas that interest me most are</strong>
+ Probability and Real Analysis 
+ Machine Learning (kind love this book [Understanding Machine Learning
From Theory to Algorithms](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/understanding-machine-learning/3059695661405D25673058E43C8BE2A6))
+ Topological Data Analysis
+ Stochastic Processes and their application in simulations
